# Random

A storage for files.

## Overview
Random is a simple storage for files. It provides a place to upload, store, and retrieve files with a minimal interface and clear conventions. This repository is a starting point — use it as a local file store, or extend it with cloud backends (S3, GCS, Azure Blob Storage) and authentication.

## Goals
- Provide a small, documented codebase for storing files.
- Be easy to extend with different backends (local filesystem, S3, etc.).
- Include examples and tests so it can be used as a learning or production starting point.

## Suggested structure
- /src — application source code
- /examples — example integrations and usage
- /docs — design decisions and API documentation
- /tests — unit and integration tests

## Quick start (conceptual)
1. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/statslt/Random
2. Install dependencies (if applicable)
3. Run the example server or script to upload and download files
4. Configure a backend (local path or cloud bucket)

## Extending
- Add an adapter interface for different storage backends.
- Add authentication/authorization for uploads and downloads.
- Add metadata (owner, upload date, content-type) for files.
- Add lifecycle rules (retention, versioning, garbage collection).

Contributions are welcome. Please open an issue or a pull request with a clear description and tests.
